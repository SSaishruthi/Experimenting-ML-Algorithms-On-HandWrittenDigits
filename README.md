# Experimenting-ML-Algorithms-On-MNIST-Dataset


- Analyzed performance of different machine learning algorithms such as Linear Classifier, KNN, Naive Bayes, Random Forest, Decision Tree,   Logistic Regression, Radial basis neural network and one/two hidden layer neural network on the benchmark dataset of MNIST for      
  recognizing hand-written digits.

- Performed dimensionality reduction on dataset using PCA, SVD and LDA techniques leading to improved performance.

- Experimented efficiency and performance of different neural network activation functions (sigmoid, ReLU and tanh) and regularization techniques (Lasso and ridge).
